# üê® FWBxRally Hackathon Submission For Team Pippins üê®

Pulse is the social layer for Rally communities.

Hosted at https://pippens.vercel.app/, test it out! 

This proof-of-concept demonstrates:
- Usage and querying of the Rally endpoints
- Automatic card creation for every existing Rally creator
- Flow for both a web3 native user and a public card

In the future, this project will be extended to include:
- Customizable cards using blocks to tailer the space to each unique creator
  - Different blocks for different creator types
- Social features to build community between fans
- Approachable education for non-web3, non-Rally fans who want to dive into the community
